  abstract =   "There is a growing awareness, both in industry and academia, of the crucial role of formally verifying the translation from high-level source-code into low-level object code that is typically performed by an optimizing compiler. Formally verifying an optimizing compiler, as one would verify any other large program, is not feasible due to its size, ongoing evolution and modification, and, possibly, proprietary considerations. Translation validation is a novel approach that offers an alternative to the verification of translators in general and compilers in particular: Rather than verifying the compiler itself, one constructs a validation tool which, after every run of the compiler, formally confirms that the target code produced in the run is a correct translation of the source program. The paper presents voc, a methodology for the translation validation of optimizing compilers. We distinguish between structure preserving optimizations, for which we establish a simulation relation between the source and target code based on computational induction, and structure modifying optimizations, for which we develop specialized permutation rules. The paper also describes voc-64 - a prototype translation validator tool that automatically produces verification conditions for the global optimizations of the SGI Pro-64 compiler.",

     abstract = {In this paper we consider a class of hybrid
          systems, namely dynamical systems
with piecewise-constant derivatives (PCD systems).
Such systems consist of a partition of the Euclidean
space into a finite set of polyhedral sets ({\it regions}). Within
each region the dynamics is defined by a constant vector field, hence
discrete transitions occur only on the boundaries between
regions where the trajectories change their direction.

With respect to such systems we investigate the reachability question:
{\it Given an effective description of the systems and of two
polyhedral subsets $P$ and $Q$ of the state-space, is there a
trajectory starting at some $\vx \in P$ and reaching some point in
$Q$? } Our main results are a decision procedure for two-dimensional
systems, and an undecidability result for three or more dimensions.},

  verification, and design of hybrid systems. The methodology consists
  of the computational model of {\em Concrete Phase Transition Systems}
  ({\sc cpts}), the specification language of {\em Hybrid Temporal Logic}
  ({\sc htl}), the graphical system description language of {\em Hybrid
  Automata}, and a proof system for verifying that hybrid automata
  satisfy their HTL specifications.
  \par
     The novelty of the approach lies in the continuous-time logic,
  which allows specification of both point-based and interval-based
  properties and provides direct references to derivatives of variables,
  and in the proof system that supports verification of point-based and
  interval-based properties. The proof rules demonstrate that sound and
  convenient induction rules can also be established for continuous-time
  logics and are not necessarily restricted to discrete logics. The
  proof rules are illustrated on several examples.},

  automatic program synthesis by means of finding a winning strategy for
  an infinite game. There are two novel features in this work. First,
  for the case of discrete systems, where both the specification and the
  program consist of finite $\o$-automata, we give a radically-simpler
  formulation of the problem and of its solution, without using the
  heavy machinery of automata on trees.  Secondly we extend these
  results to timed automata, paving the way for the application of
  program synthesis techniques to the construction of real-time embedded
  systems from their specifications.},

identification of intermediate assertions and ranking functions, and
invocation of temporal verification rules be conducted on the {\sc tpvs}\

boolean and restricted integer reasoning (Pressburger arithmetic).
Simulated reasoning with this restricted capacity indicates that about
95\% of the typically encountered verification conditions will be
resolved on the {\sc tpvs}\ level, and only few remaining formulas will be
transferred to the heavy reasoner {\sc pvs}.},

representation of Presburger arithmetic definable sets of integer
vectors. The representation consists of concurrent automata operating
on the binary encodings of the elements of the represented sets. This
representation has several advantages. First, being automata-based it
is operational in nature and hence leads directly to algorithms, for
instance all usual operations on sets of integer vectors translate
naturally to operations on automata. Second, the use of concurrent
automata makes it compact. Third, it is insensitive to the
representation size of integers. Our representation can be used
whenever arithmetic constraints are needed. To illustrate its
possibilities we show that it can handle integer programming
optimally, and that it leads to a new original algorithm for the
satisfiability of arithmetic inequalities.}

    abstract = {In the stepwise development of a distributed
          system, one has to
verify that a specification at a lower level of abstraction correctly
implements a specification at a higher level of abstraction.
We consider specifications that
are given as labelled transition systems (automata)
with fairness requirements.
Abadi and Lamport have suggested prophecy
variables and backward simulations as a proof technique to be used
in the case that the abstract specification makes nondeterministic
choices ``in advance of'' the concrete specification.
In this paper, we look more closely at this technique. We suggest
alternatives to the backward simulation technique, and compare their
relative power.
One contribution is to suggest a new simulation technique, called
delayed simulation, which in a large number of cases can
replace both forward and backward simulation as a proof technique.
We conclude the paper with a trick for circumventing the restriction
to finitariness for prophecy variables.

  proving simulation and refinement relations between programs. After
  introducing the notions of fair transition systems and the
  specification language of temporal logic, we present proof rules for
  verifying properties of programs. We then define the relations of
  simulation and refinement between programs and relate them to
  inclusion relations between computations and observations of the
  compared systems.

  We then show that these semantic definitions can be formalized in
  temporal logic by the use of the temporal and observational semantics
  formulas. This representation expresses simulation and refinement as
  implications between a pair of such formulas. We provide proof rules,
  based on the rules for verifying program properties. The proof rules
  are illustrated on several simple examples. Towards the end of the
  first part, we recognize the usefulness of having a stuttering-robust
  version of temporal logic.

  The second part of the paper presents a proposed temporal logic,
  called \tlr, which is insensitive to stuttering. This logic is
  interpreted over sequences of sampling points, alternating between
  persistent and transient sample points. This logic possesses an
  idempotent next-time operator, which gives some insight into its
  stuttering robustness. We present a decision procedure and a complete
  axiomatic system for the propositional version of \tlr. It is shown
  that, if all system variables are taken to be left-continuous, then
  most of the rules of regular temporal logic are still sound for \tlr.

  Finally, we present a stronger proof rule for refinement, and
  illustrate its use to prove refinement of two programs that cannot be
  done within the regular temporal logic framework.}
